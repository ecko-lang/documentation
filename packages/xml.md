# xml

An XML parser for Ecko: parse to a node tree, query by tag or path, extract text, and rebuild. Pure - no capabilities.

```bash
ecko get github.com/ecko-lang/xml
```

```ecko
import xml
```

Pure computation: it declares no capabilities, so it cannot touch the network, the filesystem or the environment.

Version 0.10.1 - [source](https://github.com/ecko-lang/xml) - MIT.

## `parse(src)`

Parse an XML document into a node tree. The root is a `#root` node whose
children are the top-level elements; text becomes `#text` nodes.

## `text(node)`

All text under a node, concatenated - the element's own text plus every
descendant's, in document order. Returns "" for an element with no text.

## `find(node, path)`

find(node, path) - a single tag matches descendants; "a/b/c" navigates:
the first segment matches descendants, each further segment its children.

## `attr(node, name)`

One attribute's value, or null when the node has no such attribute.

## `build(node)`

build(node) -> an XML string (attrs sorted; empty elements self-close).
